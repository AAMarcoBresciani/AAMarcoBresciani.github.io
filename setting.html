	<h3>New York City</h3>
	<p>A crowded city known as "The City That Never Sleeps" and "The Big Apple", the streets have lots of traffic during the day. New York City is also famous for its landmarks like the Statue of Liberty and Central Park. New York City is actually a great city with a lot to see, tons of stores, and a lot of taxis.</p>

	<h3>Each Others' Apartments</h3>
	<p style="font-size: 1.75em">Though the main setting of <i>Friends</i> is New York City, the settings focused on are just smaller parts of New York City. For example, most of the time they just spend time in their apartments (since New York City doesn't have houses). There are three apartments mainly seen within the show, Ross's Apartment (later seasons; eventually Ross and Rachel's Apartment), Rachel and Monica's Apartment (later Monica and Chandler's Apartment), and Joey and Chandler's Apartment (later just Joey's). But most of the time, it is just Rachel and Monica's Apartment they hang out in because as Joey states "it's the one with the food,". There was even an episode where Joey and Chandler switch apartments with Monica and Rachel. It was also the last setting seen in the show.</p>

	<h3>Central Perk</h3>
	<p style="font-size: 1.75em">Another main setting of <i>Friends</i> is the character's favorite coffee house Central Perk (get it). It was coincidentally the first setting seen in the show. In the first episode they were sitting around talking and Rachel comes into the place in her wedding dress. It is also the place where the most discussions are brought up. For example, Joey was trying to figure out what he should use as a stage name, and Chandler suggested "Joseph Stalin". Or when Phoebe was arguing with Ross over the existence of evolution. It is also where Phoebe plays her songs like <i>Smelly Cat</i>.</p>
